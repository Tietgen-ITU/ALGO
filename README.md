# ALGO
My mandatory tasks and exercises regarding the course in algorithms and data structures at ITU
The focus of these tasks is the application scenarios for the different data structures and algorithms that we have been through.

## Structure of the files.
In this project we have everything in seperate folder regarding a specific task that is supposed to be solved. 
So that means that we have the following
- A folder with the name of the task
- A class with the famous static main method as a start entry to solve the task.
- Zero or more data classes depending on the task.

## Important
This repository does not change and will not change. Every request for change will be denied!
